<p>Erin Leary is a Ph.D candidate in Visual and Cultural Studies at the University of Rochester. Her dissertation, "Decorating for Discrimination: Nativism and Eugenics in American Decorative and Domestic Arts, 1893-1924," positions gardens, ceramics, textiles, gift books, and interiors as sites for women's participation in the immigration restriction and eugenics movements at the turn of the twentieth century. Focusing primarily on works from the Arts and Crafts and Colonial Revival movements, she argues in this work that these antimodern forms mobilized "traditional" aesthetics as forms of political modernity. </p>
<p>Her work on this project is supported by the Douglass Foundation Fellowship in American Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and previously a dissertation fellowship from Winterthur Museum, Estate and Library.  She is adjunct faculty in Art and Design History and Theory at Parsons, The New School for Design.</p>
